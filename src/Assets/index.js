So, make sure not to behave in a way that you don’t want your kid to learn.','Use a bilateral way. Don’t just stop your kid from doing wrong deeds but also motivate them to do acceptable ones. If you tell them “Don’t hit” you can replace it with “be gentle” or “be kind”.','You can set some clear and consistent rules for them to follow.

It should feel genuine.','Avoid saying sentences like “you’re the best child in the entire world” rather you can say something like “well done my dear, thank you for putting your toys back on the shelf”.','For example, if your child loves to listen to music while studying, then it can lead to hindrance, so allow them to listen to only instrumental music.

They ought to have a better reason than this. Make them understand with a proper explanation but don’t make it too preachy.","Make sure you’re using age-appropriate language or something they can comprehend in their little minds.","You can also take help from their school.

The discipline committee at CBSE schools of Bangalore follows a mix of both active and passive strategies and you can learn the same.","When you ignore their bad behaviors, they’ll face the natural consequences and refrain from repeating them in the future. For instance, if your little one keeps dropping the candies on purpose, then he’ll end up wasting it and will be left with no more candies to eat.","If they have a habit of throwing their toys, then ignore them and don’t buy new ones. They’ll soon fathom their importance when they won’t have any toys left or at least their favorite one.","Letting them realize on their own is one of the most effective ways of disciplining."]
